                        <p class="lead">
                            Dear Invision Design Team,
                            <br>
                        </p>

                        <p class="intro-body">
                            I saw that you are looking for a product designer on the Invision website. With this cover letter, I would like to express
                            my strong interest in this vacancy as I believe that my broad skills and employment background
                            are a suitable match for the position.
                            <br>
                            <br>I have been turning complex real-world problems into effective design solutions in freelancing
                            work and in-house product experience for 3 years. Throughout my career, I have familiarized myself
                            with all aspects of production, including UI/UX, research, and prototyping. The reason I could
                            be powerful enough to work as the only designer in a small team and freelancing alone was because
                            of the tools that I use. Invision is one of the most powerful tools, not only in creating prototypes,
                            but also for building relationships with my clients and co-workers.
                            <br>
                            <br>I believe that Invision is making a positive and huge impact on the design community with many
                            internal and external relationships. Platforms such as blogs, forums, and educational ones have
                            proved that Invision is more than a design tool, but is a place that connects and empower people.
                            I have been always fascinated by the strength of platforms that affect work-flows, design process,
                            and even people's daily lives in broad ways. Since I have a strong ability to take complex concepts
                            of product, bring them to life, and create compelling stories with simple and beautiful visuals,
                            I believe I can contribute to making Invision even better.
                            <br>

                            <br> I would love to use my previous experience with Invision as part of product design and continue
                            my enthusiasm for building this powerful tool (that has such a great impact on people's lives).
                            <br>
                            <br> I look forward to discussing the product designer vacancy at Invision. Thank you for taking
                            the time to consider my application.

                            <br>
                            <br> Sincerely,

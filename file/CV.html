                        <p class="lead">
                            Dear Invision Design Team,
                            <br>
                        </p>

                        <p class="intro-body">
                            On the Invision website, I saw that you are looking for a product designer. With this cover letter, I would like to express
                            my strong interest in this position and believe that my broad skills and employment background
                            are a suitable match for the position.
                            <br>
                            <br>For years I have been turning complex real-world problems into effective design solutions in
                            freelancing work and in-house product experience. During the design journey, I’ve been familiarizing
                            myself with all aspects of production, including UI/UX, research, design systems, and prototyping.
                            The reason I could be powerful enough to work as a only-one designer in a small team and freelancing
                            alone was because of the tools that I use. Invision is one of the most powerful tools that has
                            been together with me throughout my career not only just in creating prototypes but also building
                            relationships with my clients and co-workers.
                            <br>
                            <br>I believe Invision is giving positive and huge impact on the design Industry with a lot of internal
                            and external relationships. External works especially like Blogs, Forums, Educations has given
                            an image that Invision is more than design tool but a place that connects people and gives them
                            synergy. I've been always fascinated by the power of tools that affect work-flows, design process,
                            and ultimately people's daily lives. I believe that my strength in design is finding hidden opportunity
                            of relationships between designer and many stakeholders and define them something that really
                            matters. I expect that it would be a really interesting challenge to dig out the infinite possibility
                            of Invision but I believe i can contribute to make it better.
                            <br>

                            <br> I would love to use my previous experience with Invision as part of product design with building
                            relationships
                            <br>
                            <br>Thank you very much for taking the time to consider my application.

                            <br>
                            <br> Sincerely,
                            <br>
